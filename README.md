# X-Agency-Case-Study

This is a hypothetical case study performed on marketing survey data. There's nothing particularly new or innovative about anything here, but I decided to share it to demonstrate some proficiency in statistical analysis.

The types of analyses performed herein include:

- Kruskal-Wallis Test
- Dunn's Test
- Chi-Squared Tests

## Modules You'll Need

It's easiest to clone this if you have Python installed within an Anaconda environment (ideally conda-forge). However, should you wish to have an explicit list of modules that you would need, here it is. Scikit-Posthocs is not included in a normal Conda environment, so it needed to be installed explicity with pip:

- pandas                    0.24.2 
- matplotlib                3.0.3
- scipy                     1.2.1
- scikit-posthocs           0.6.1 

It's possible that the notebook will function with versions lower than this, but for declarative clarity I opted to include the ones that the notebook was created on.
